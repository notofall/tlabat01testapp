# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "DELIVERY TRACKING FEATURE IMPLEMENTED: Fixed bug in SupervisorDashboard.js (ordersRes was undefined). Tested full workflow: 1) Ship PO as manager via PUT /api/purchase-orders/{id}/ship 2) Supervisor sees shipped order in 'Pending Deliveries' section 3) Supervisor clicks 'Receipt' button, dialog opens with item details 4) Supervisor clicks 'All' to receive full quantity 5) Confirms delivery 6) Order status changes to 'delivered'. All working correctly. Need testing subagent to verify edge cases."

    message: "DELIVERY TRACKING COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED - 100% SUCCESS: ✅ All Backend APIs Working: Ship Order API correctly ships printed orders and prevents invalid shipping attempts. Pending Delivery API shows shipped orders to supervisor, correctly restricts access for managers. Deliver Order API handles partial/full deliveries with correct status updates, validates invalid order IDs. Delivery Records API returns complete delivery history. ✅ Frontend UI Fully Functional: Supervisor dashboard displays pending deliveries count in stats, shows pending deliveries section with shipped orders, delivery dialog opens with correct item details showing required/delivered/remaining quantities, 'الكل' button auto-fills remaining quantities, delivery confirmation works with success messages and real-time UI updates. ✅ Complete Workflow Verified: End-to-end testing from request creation → engineer approval → PO creation → manager approval → printer printing → manager shipping → supervisor partial delivery → supervisor full delivery → final 'delivered' status. All 30 backend tests passed (100% success rate). All edge cases properly handled including shipping validation and delivery quantity validation. Delivery tracking feature is fully working and ready for production use."
